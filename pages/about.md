**Results Sep-2023**

Scenario explanation:

"B2" = Reference Scenario. No Sub-optimal Heat Pumps and B2 EPC required for Optimal Heat Pump. 

"B2OS" = Same as Reference Scenario, but sun-optimal Heat Pumps permitted. 

"HLI2.5" - Heat Loss Indication (HLI) of 2.5 of less required for optimal HP, suboptimal HP permitted. 

"HLI3" - Heat Loss Indication (HLI) of 3 of less required for optimal HP, suboptimal HP permitted.
